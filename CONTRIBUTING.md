# Troubleshooting

## Command not found

https://typicode.github.io/husky/troubleshooting.html#command-not-found

If you're running Git from an app and the command can be found in your terminal, this means that the `PATH` in your app is different from your terminal.

You can `echo $PATH` in your terminal and configure your app to use the same value.

If you've installed your command using `brew`, see the [Homebrew FAQ](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ) to make your command available to your app.

Finally, if you're using a script for managing versions like `nvm`, `n`, `rbenv`, `pyenv`, ... you can use `~/.huskyrc` to load the necessary before running hooks.

For example, for `nvm` that would be:

::: code-group

```shell [~/.huskyrc]
# This loads nvm.sh, sets the correct PATH before running hook, and ensures the project version of Node
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"

[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

# If you have an .nvmrc file, we use the relevant node version
if [[ -f ".nvmrc" ]]; then
  nvm use
fi
```
